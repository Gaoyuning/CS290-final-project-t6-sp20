                    Medical Neuroscience explores

                    framework for understanding
                    human behavior. In this course,
                    you will discover the organization
                    of the neural systems in the brain
                    and spinal cord that mediate
                    sensation, motivate bodily action,
                    and integrate sensorimotor signals
                    with memory, emotion and related
                    faculties of cognition. The overall
                    goal of this course is to provide the
                    foundation for understanding the
                    impairments of sensation, action
                    and cognition that accompany injury,

                    Vision may feel effortless:
                    you open your eyes, and the
                    world appears. But the process
                    of focusing light into image on
                    the back of the eye and translating
                    it into meaningful nerve signals
                    is incredibly complex. The retina
                    and visual cortex are packed with
                    intricate processing circuitry,
                    and have been a mystery to
                    neuroscientists for centuries.
                    Now, answers are beginning to emerge.
